# Data Mining using R 

Welcome to Clemson University's Cyberinfrastructure and Technology Integration Training Workshops!

This workshop focuses on data mining techniques in R, with the following learning objectives:

- Understand data acquisition: downloading from static links, crawling through entire websites, and streaming data from real-time sources
- Understand data curation: parsing unstructured/semi-structured data (text, XML, JSON, ...) into structured format
- Understand data management: organizing data directories, working with databases
- Understand HPC concepts: automating data-mining process through the Palmetto Supercomputer

This is an intermediate workshop, and it is recommended that you either have attended or are comfortable with materials presented 
in the following workshops:

- [Introduction to Linux](https://github.com/clemsonciti/linux-workshop)
- [Introduction to Research Computing](https://github.com/clemsonciti/hpc-workshop)
- [Introduction to Data Science using R](https://github.com/clemsonciti/data-science-r-01)


Prior to coming to the workshop, please make sure that you have completed the 
**[preparation steps](https://github.com/clemsonciti/data-mining-r-workshop/blob/master/0_preparations.ipynb)** 
to set up the required libraries and Twitter streaming authentication tokens.
